# professional-portfolio-challenge

## Description
I developed this professional portfolio to display my projects to anyone interested in my work. I built it so there would be only one spot for people to look instead of searching through my GitHub repositories. I learned about creating cards, media queries, and other advanced CSS properties.

## Usage

This portfolio is divided into three sections: About Me, Work, and Contact Me. The sections can be accessed through the Navigation bar, where you are taken to these pages just by clicking on the section. The About Me is just that, about me! There are a few paragraphs about my journey into the tech industry. The Work section contains links to projects I've done with titles and images. Clicking on these images will take you to the deployment link for the projects. Projects 2-5 are placeholders at the moment. The Contact Me section provides links to a phone number, my GitHub, my Twitter, and my Spotify accounts. The phone number is also a placeholder since this is a public project.
